Creating a mock photographer's portfolio using React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

Project written using React functional components. Javascript/JSX/HTML and CSS files in /src/components/ written by me and rendered through /src/app.js
